## How to build and run

To build this project you need to use [SDK from Atlassian](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/downloads/).
You can build this project immediately with `atlas-mvn package`.<br/>
Upload the plugin after build example:
```atlas-install-plugin --context-path "" --server localhost -p 8090 --username admin --password admin```. <br/>
Other option: You can upload the build JAR from /target directory and install in your confluence admin area.

If you don't have a running local confluence for testing, you can use this:
Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
